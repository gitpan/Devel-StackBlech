NAME
    Devel::StackBlech - Dumps your stack, all of it, somewhere

FUNCTIONS
  PERL FUNCTIONS
    dumpStacks()
        Dumps your stack to "Perl_debug_log" which is usually pointed at
        STDERR. Happens to also display DB::sub calls which are normally
        invisible. Please hack on this if you want more features. Commit
        bits are handed out freely.

  C FUNCTIONS
    All of the following C functions are available for importing.

    void dsb_dumpStacks()
        Dump all levels of the interpreter's runloop stacks.

        This is the backend, reuseable implementation for the perl function
        "dumpStacks()".

    void dsb_dumpFrames( PERL_SI *si )
        Dump all contexts in this runloop level.

    void dsb_dumpFrame( const PERL_CONTEXT *const cx )
        Dump a context.
